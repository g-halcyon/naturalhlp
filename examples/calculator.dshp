Create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

First, ask the user to enter two numbers.
Then ask the user to choose an operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
Perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
Display the result with an appropriate message.

If the user selects division and the second number is zero, display an error message saying "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."

After showing the result, ask the user if they want to perform another calculation (yes/no).
If they say yes, repeat the process.
If they say no, display a goodbye message and end the program.
