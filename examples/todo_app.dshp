Create a simple command-line TODO application with the following features:
- Add a new task with a description and priority (high, medium, low)
- List all tasks sorted by priority
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Save tasks to a file and load them when the program starts
- Display a menu with options for the user to choose from

The application should keep running until the user chooses to exit.
Make sure to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
